# NerdBot

A completely over-engineered solution to automating features in the SkyBlock Nerds Discord server.

## Features

### Greenlighting Suggestions

The bot will automatically track and greenlight suggestions that reach a specified ratio.

### Channel Groups

A ChannelGroup is two channels that are linked together to submit and collect approved suggestions.

### Reaction Tracking

The bot will automatically track reactions from users on suggestions and store them for later use.

## Config

An example config file can be
found [here](https://github.com/TheMGRF/NerdBot/blob/master/src/main/resources/example-config.json).

Depending on the current environment, the configuration file will either be named `production.config.json`
or `dev.config.json`

Changes to the configuration file require the bot to be restarted.
